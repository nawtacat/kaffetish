Instead, it will be contracting with a new national vendor, 'Fresh & Fast,' known for its standardized menus and efficient service. The change is intended to provide more consistent service and a wider variety of options.

Campus Cuisine was great because they would often have special menus and try new recipes. It was interesting. I think a standardized menu is going to get boring really fast. It's less variety, not more." }
